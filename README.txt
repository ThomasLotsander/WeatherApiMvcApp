Simple web application where I use a weatherApi to get accurate weather data

Tried to get a hold of xunit tests and moq to test some of the code.

Simply start the project and from the homepage you can
search for any city. The current weather will be displayed when the button is pressed.
You can change in what format the weather will appear from a simple dropdown-list.
You also have optional parameter to specify the country code if you want.
